Different stages:

1. Download:
- Resulting files can be used for: collecting monolingual data
- Parameters: crawlname, output directory, (sshloginfile)

2. Collect monolingual data:
- File transformation: .gz -> .gz
  -> We use .gz as a result since it is much faster in compression
- Resulting files can be used for: deduplication and raw files
- Parameters: languages, input directory, output directory, (sshloginfile)

- Run through each folder an split data according to language
- We might have to fix data that is broken

3. Create raw files:
- File transformation: Anything -> .xz
  -> NOTE: compression with xz takes a long time.
- Resulting files can be used for: None
- Parameters: languages, input directory, output directory, (sshloginfile)

- For non-en: Merge all the files from step (2)
- Possible to do this step after step (4) since compression takes a long time

4. Create Deduped files:
- File transformation: Anything -> .xz
- Resulting files can be used for: None
- Parameters: languages, files for input, previous deduped file, output directory, (sshloginfile)

- Can run deduper on files from step (2)
