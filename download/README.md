# Download CommonCrawl data

Scripts for the monolingual pipeline as described in [here](https://github.com/ModernMT/DataCollection/blob/master/metadata/metadata.md). 
`setup.sh` creates all necessary directories and downloads all target urls. `download_wet.sh` does the actual download. 
`count_downloads.sh` counts how many files are already downloaded.
